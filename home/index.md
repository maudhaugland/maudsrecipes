## **Find your next favourite sweet bun recipe!**

**Who doesn’t love a sweet bun?** 

Since the 1950s, Scandinavians have been crazy about sweet buns, or *boller*, so much so that the smell of freshly baked sweet buns just out of the oven is seen as the ultimate sign of a nice, cosy home. And I don’t know what Scandinavians value more than being cosy. The Danish concept of *hygge* and the Swedish *fika* have become quite popular here in the UK the last few years, and the sweet bun is an essential part of both *hygge* and *fika*. Now I want to show you how to make some of my favourite sweet buns so you can implement the Scandinavian way of having a cosy time into your life.

***Enjoy!***
