## **Ingredients**

* 50 g yeast (fresh)
* 1,5 dl lukewarm water
* 75 g melted butter
* 2 dl milk
* 75 g sugar
* 1 teaspoon cardamom 
* 500 g wheat flour



## Method

1. Take the yeast and pull it apart with your fingers into small crumbs and put it into the lukewarm water to dissolve the yeast. 
2. Melt the butter. Mix the milk into the melted butter before adding it into the yeast mixture. Add the sugar, cardamom and flour gradually while slowly mixing it in a food processor. 
3. When the dough is mixed, turn up the speed of the food processor until the dough is no longer sticking to the bowl. Add a bit of flour if it is too sticky. 
4. When satisfied, put a kitchen towel over the bowl and let the dough rest for an hour.
5. Take the dough out of the bowl and divide it into about 16 equal pieces. Roll them into balls with your hands. 
6. Add your desired filling. 
7. Let them rest on a baking sheet for an hour.
8. Paint them with lukewarm milk. Put them in the middle of the oven at 230℃ fan, for ca. 10 minutes, until they are a nice golden brown. Take them out of the oven and let them cool down. Enjoy!
